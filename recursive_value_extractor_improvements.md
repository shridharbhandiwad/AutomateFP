# Recursive Value Extractor - Improvements Summary

## Problem Fixed
The original script had a recursion depth error that could cause stack overflow when processing deeply nested MATLAB data structures. The extracted values were not organized in meaningful variables for further processing.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Proper Recursion Depth Control
- **Fixed depth checking**: Changed from `indent > max_depth` to `indent >= max_depth` to prevent off-by-one errors
- **Reduced default depth**: Set maximum recursion depth to 8 (from 10) for safety
- **Early termination**: Added proper early termination when reaching maximum depth
- **Depth tracking**: Added current depth display in console output for monitoring

### 2. Meaningful Variable Storage
All extracted values are now organized into structured, meaningful variables:

#### Extraction Metadata
```python
extraction_metadata = {
    "dep_id": dep_id,
    "cycle_number": cycle_number,
    "timestamp": timestamp_value,
    "extraction_status": "completed",
    "max_recursion_depth": 8,
    "extraction_levels": {}
}
```

#### Navigation Steps
```python
navigation_steps = {
    "step_1_root": {
        "level_name": "g_PerDepRunnable_m_depPort_out",
        "description": "Root level dependency data",
        "extraction_result": {...},
        "success": True
    },
    "step_2_listmemory": {...},
    "step_3_first_value": {...},
    "step_4_second_value": {...},
    "step_5_final_values": {...}
}
```

#### Organized Extracted Values
```python
extracted_values = {
    "extraction_parameters": {
        "dep_id": dep_id,
        "cycle_number": cycle_number
    },
    "navigation_data": {...},
    "final_extracted_values": {...},
    "value_hierarchy": {
        "numeric_values": {...},
        "array_values": {...},
        "structured_values": {...},
        "error_values": {...}
    },
    "extraction_statistics": {...}
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Comprehensive error tracking**: All errors are captured and categorized
- **Graceful degradation**: Script continues processing even when individual fields fail
- **Detailed error information**: Error type, message, and location are all tracked

### 4. Improved Field Processing
- **Field metadata**: Each field includes type, shape, size, and dtype information
- **Extraction methods**: Different handling for multi-dimensional arrays vs scalars
- **Value categorization**: Automatic categorization of extracted values by type

### 5. Better Output Organization
- **Hierarchical structure**: Values are organized in a clear hierarchy
- **Extraction summary**: Provides statistics about successful/failed extractions
- **Navigation tracking**: Shows success/failure of each navigation step
- **File output**: Results are saved to JSON file for further analysis

## Benefits

1. **No more recursion depth errors**: The script can now handle deeply nested structures safely
2. **Meaningful data organization**: All values are stored in well-structured, accessible variables
3. **Better debugging**: Clear tracking of where extraction succeeds or fails
4. **Extensible design**: Easy to add new extraction methods or modify existing ones
5. **Production ready**: Robust error handling and comprehensive logging

## Usage
The improved script maintains the same command-line interface:
```bash
python3 recursive_value_extractor.py <dep_id> <cycle_number>
```

But now provides much more comprehensive and organized output, with all values stored in meaningful variables ready for further processing.

## Test Results
The script successfully processed the test case (dep_id=0, cycle_number=100) without any recursion depth errors, properly organizing all extracted values into meaningful variables and providing detailed extraction statistics.
